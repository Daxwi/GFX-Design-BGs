# GFX Design BGs
This is where my album design service information is located, it contains "Prices, How to Order, Notes & Sample Previews".
Each album is made in a clean, easy to look at, and modern feel.

#### The price of each album:
> - Tier 1: 30 Wist (Medium)
> - Tier 2: 45 Wist (Quality)

#### How to order:
Depending on the customer's request. When you want to order please follow the format below and send it to `@daxwi` (Discord).
> - Name Character: *name*
> - Series: *series*
> - How many cards for 1 album: *number*
> - Tier: *number*
> - (not required) Image of the character you want me to make: *official link image*
> - (not required) Style or Sample: *write in*
> - (not required) Layout: *upload the image you drew*

#### Notes: 
1. Whoever requests first will have priority, lining up in turn.
2. I often lose ideas, wait patiently until I think of something new.
3. All the BGs i do are "Private".
4. Keep an eye on my Discord Status, if you see the text then im in the process of designing some BGs. If not then i dont have any orders yet.
